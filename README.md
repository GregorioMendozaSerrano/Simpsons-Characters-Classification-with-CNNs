# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Classification for Simpsons Characters
Author: Gregorio Mendoza Serrano

In this activity, we will work with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to solve an image classification problem. Specifically, we will classify images of characters from *The Simpsons*.

The dataset consists of images of characters from the show, extracted directly from episodes. This dataset has been compiled by Alexandre Attia. Among the 18 labeled characters, they appear in various poses, different positions within the image, or alongside other characters on-screen (although the character to be classified is always in the dominant position).

The dataset and additional information can be downloaded from the following link:
